# Front-End-Template
The building blocks for any self-respecting modern front end app.


QUANTUM-WEB-DESIGN- Front-End Template.

This is a set if files, and their corresponding internal CDNs, that can be copied to create a web application or website from scratch using Bootstrap, jQuery, and React.

Currently available through GitHub and Codepen [See it here](https://codepen.io/QuantumBitDesign/pen/pWbmXm) but look for it @ quantumbitdesign.com in the near future.

There is nothing to install with this. This web app will work in most if not all web browsers such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, and Safari- especially those that have been properly updated! Hint Hint... It is being designed with accessibility in mind, will be built using a mobile first approach, and will be optimized on the front end for speed using minification, custom picture sizing, and other techniques.
